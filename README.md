Heart Disease Prediction
This project aims to predict heart disease based on various patient features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more. The dataset was analyzed, cleaned, and used to train several classification models to determine the best approach for predicting the presence of heart disease.

This is my first project on Kaggle, where I applied machine learning concepts including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

Project Overview
Objective: Predict whether a patient has heart disease using machine learning models.
Dataset: The dataset contains information about patients, including demographic and medical features.
Models Used:
Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
After training and evaluating the models, the Random Forest Classifier was selected as the best model, achieving an accuracy of 83.77% and a recall of 85.98%.
